This year, as the grand finale for their coin collection campaign, they hosted a student versus teacher volleyball game. LLS attended the game and presented them with a check to show gratitude for their contributions and dedication to LLS mission. Out of 137 schools, they are currently the top fundraising Virginia school. With almost an additional $100 in just one week, they have raised a total of $6,552 to-date for LLS’s Pennies for Patients program. </p>

                        As we close out the 2020-21 school year and quickly approach the start of summer learning, we are providing you with updated guidance regarding the use of face masks while on school property beginning June 18 in accordance with Executive Order 79.

                        Indoors On-School Property

                        EO79 requires that all individuals wear a mask while indoors on school property. Masks or face coverings must be worn by all students, faculty, staff, and visitors regardless of vaccination status.
                        This includes all activities on school property beyond education, including School Board meetings and concerts, graduations, voting, attendees at performances, etc.
                        Social distancing is not required.
                        As of June 11, the Commonwealth updated guidance to say that when school is not in session (or anytime students are not attending programs in the school building), individuals should follow masking recommendations in accordance with CDC Guidance, which allows for fully vaccinated individuals to participate in most activities without masking or distancing. Individuals who are not yet fully vaccinated should continue to mask and distance in order to protect themselves and the people around them.
                        Outdoors On-School Property

                        EO79 permits individuals outdoors on school property to remove masks in accordance with CDC guidance.
                        Fully vaccinated students, teachers, staff, and visitors may remove their masks or face coverings. Six feet social distancing is not required.
                        Individuals who are not fully vaccinated may remove masks or face coverings outside if they can maintain at least six feet distance. If they cannot maintain social distancing, it is recommended that they wear a mask.
                        Offices and Non-School Property

                        In office buildings such as Gatehouse, neither masks nor social distancing will be required for vaccinated employees.

                        Below is a quick reference guide regarding mask usage for Schools and Non-School based Offices, effective June 18, 2021, as outlined in the above narrative.

                        *Mask exemptions as outlined in Executive Order 79 continue to be applicable (e.g. while eating or drinking) and are consistent with exemptions implemented during the 2020-21 school year.

                        Fairfax County Public Schools’ contract with Blackboard ends on June 30. The new learning management system is Schoology (pronounced /SKOO-luh-jee/). Schoology is a learning space that enhances communication, collaboration, and personalized learning for students, teachers, and families. Schoology will be used division-wide starting in July.

                        Schoology was chosen to:

                        Support and implement instructional practices aligned to our learning model.
                        Help students reach the Portrait of a Graduate goals.
                        Provide all students with equitable access to meaningful learning experiences.
                        Offer anytime access to their virtual learning space.
                        Students will have a Schoology account by June 18.

                        Students use their FCPS student ID and password to login to Schoology.
                        Students will not see any classes until the grading period starts.
                        As a parent or guardian, you will be able to use Schoology to view:

                        Your child’s class.
                        Your child’s assignments and participation.
                        Your child’s calendar.
                        Teacher comments, scores, and feedback.
                        Parent accounts will be available in mid-August. To access Schoology, parents will need to have an active SIS/ParentVUE account.

                        More information about Schoology is available online.
